# torture-sort
my biggest inspration for doing this was @gustavo-depaula 's stalin sort. you can check that out at https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort
basically how this works (as you could probably know from the title) it gets a list of random numbers and tortures them(-a random number between 1 and 100) so they will be sorted in the end. 
i would like to see this done in other programming languages (bcz i only know python ):  )
(the only reason i did this was to add another one to the list of stupid sorting methods)
